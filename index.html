    <div>
      <p>
        There are two syntaxes available for Sass. The first, known as SCSS
        (Sassy CSS) and used throughout this reference, is an extension of the
        syntax of CSS. This means that every valid CSS stylesheet is a valid
        SCSS file with the same meaning. In addition, SCSS understands most
        CSS hacks and vendor-specific syntax, such as IE's old filter syntax.
        This syntax is enhanced with the Sass features described below. Files
        using this syntax have the .scss extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second and older syntax, known as the indented syntax (or
        sometimes just "Sass"), provides a more concise way of writing CSS. It
        uses indentation rather than brackets to indicate nesting of
        selectors, and newlines rather than semicolons to separate properties.
        Some people find this to be easier to read and quicker to write than
        SCSS. The indented syntax has all the same features, although some of
        them have slightly different syntax; this is described in the indented
        syntax reference. Files using this syntax have the .sass extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either syntax can import files written in the other. Files can be
        automatically converted from one syntax to the other using the
        sass-convert command line tool:
      </p>
      <code># Convert Sass to SCSS<br> 
        $ sass-convert style.sass style.scss<br> 
        # Convert SCSS to Sass<br> 
        $ sass-convert style.scss style.sass</code>
      <p> 
        Note that this command does not generate CSS files. For that, use the
        sass command described elsewhere.
      </p>

  <section id="Using_Sass" class="main-section">
    <header>Using Sass</header>
    <div>
      <p>
        Sass can be used in three ways: as a command-line tool, as a
        standalone Ruby module, and as a plugin for any Rack-enabled
        framework, including Ruby on Rails and Merb. The first step for all of
        these is to install the Sass gem:
      </p>
      <code>gem install sass </code>
      <p>If you're using Windows, you may need to install Ruby first.</p>
      <p>To run Sass from the command line, just use</p>
      <code>sass input.scss output.css </code>
      <p>
        You can also tell Sass to watch the file and update the CSS every time
        the Sass file changes:
      </p>
      <code>sass --watch input.scss:output.css</code>
      <p>
        If you have a directory with many Sass files, you can also tell Sass
        to watch the entire directory:
      </p>
      <code>sass --watch app/sass:public/stylesheets</code>
      <p>Use sass --help for full documentation.</p>
      <p>
        Using Sass in Ruby code is very simple. After installing the Sass gem,
        you can use it by running require "sass" and using Sass::Engine like
        so:
      </p>
      <code>engine = Sass::Engine.new("#main {background-color: #0000ff}",
          :syntax => :scss) engine.render #=> "#main { background-color:
          #0000ff; }\n"</code>
    </div>
  </section>

    <header>CSS Extensions</header>
    <div>
      <h3>Nested Rules</h3>
      <p>
        Sass allows CSS rules to be nested within one another. The inner rule
        then only applies within the outer rule's selector. For example:
      </p>
      <code>#main p { <br>
        color: #00ff00; <br>
        width: 97%; <br>
          .redbox { <br>
             background-color:#ff0000; <br>
             color: #000000; } }
            </code>
      <p>is compiled to:</p>
      <code>#main p { <br>
        color: #00ff00; <br>
        width: 97%; }<br> 
        #main p .redbox {<br>
          background-color: #ff0000;<br> 
          color: #000000; }
        </code>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section id="Comments" class="main-section">
    <header>Comments</header>
    <div>
      <p>
        Sass supports standard multiline CSS comments with /* */, as well as
        single-line comments with //. The multiline comments are preserved in
        the CSS output where possible, while the single-line comments are
        removed. For example:
      </p>
      <code>/* This comment is * several lines long. * since it uses the CSS
          comment syntax, * it will appear in the CSS output. */ body { color:
          black; } // These comments are only one line long each. // They won't
          appear in the CSS output, // since they use the single-line comment
          syntax. a { color: green; }</code>
      <p>is compiled to:</p>
      <code>/* This comment is * several lines long. * since it uses the CSS
          comment syntax, * it will appear in the CSS output. */ body { color:
          black; } a { color: green; }
        </code>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section id="SassScript" class="main-section">
    <header>SassScript</header>
    <div>
      <p>
        In addition to the plain CSS property syntax, Sass supports a small
        set of extensions called SassScript. SassScript allows properties to
        use variables, arithmetic, and extra functions. SassScript can be used
        in any property value.
      </p>
      <p>
        SassScript can also be used to generate selectors and property names,
        which is useful when writing mixins. This is done via interpolation.
      </p>
      <h3>Interactive Shell</h3>
      <p>
        You can easily experiment with SassScript using the interactive shell.
        To launch the shell run the sass command-line with the -i option. At
        the prompt, enter any legal SassScript expression to have it evaluated
        and the result printed out for you:
      </p>
      <code>$ sass -i >> "Hello, Sassy World!" "Hello, Sassy World!" >> 1px + 1px
          + 1px 3px >> #777 + #777 #eeeeee >> #777 + #888 white</code>
    </div>
